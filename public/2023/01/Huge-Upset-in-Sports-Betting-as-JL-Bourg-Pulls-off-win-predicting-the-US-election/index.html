<p>The little-known betting outfit had initially offered odds of 500/1 for anyone who wanted to bet on a Trump victory, and when the votes were tallied it was revealed that they had cleaned up, with hundreds of people winning large amounts of money.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the company said: “We’re absolutely delighted with our success. We knew that Trump would win all along, and our customers are now smiling all the way to the bank.”</p>
<p>The news comes as a huge shock to the sporting world, as most experts had predicted a Hillary Clinton victory. It was also a major upset for online gambling sites, which had placed heavy odds on her winning.</p>
<p>JL Bourg is a small but growing bookmaker based in southern France. The company has only been around since 2013, but it has made a big impact by offering some of the best odds in the business. In fact, they have become so well known for their accurate predictions that they have even started to offer odds on political events such as the US election.</p>
<h1 id="JL-Bourg-proves-they-are-a-betting-powerhouse-by-predicting-election-outcome"><a href="#JL-Bourg-proves-they-are-a-betting-powerhouse-by-predicting-election-outcome" class="headerlink" title="JL Bourg proves they are a betting powerhouse by predicting election outcome"></a>JL Bourg proves they are a betting powerhouse by predicting election outcome</h1><p>On November 8th, 2016, JL Bourg released a statement predicting the outcome of the U.S. Presidential Election. The company’s CEO, Jean-Luc Bourg, stated that they were “98% certain” that Donald Trump would be elected President of the United States.</p>
<p>This prediction was met with mixed reactions from the public. Some people believed that JL Bourg was simply trying to make a name for themselves by accurately predicting one of the most controversial elections in U.S. history. Others were impressed by the company’s confident predictions and saw it as a sign that they were a betting powerhouse to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>In the end, JL Bourg’s prediction was accurate – Donald Trump was elected President of the United States. This has only served to further cement the company’s reputation as a leading authority on betting predictions.</p>

<h1 id="Punters-back-JL-Bourg-in-sports-betting-for-who-will-win-the-US-election"><a href="#Punters-back-JL-Bourg-in-sports-betting-for-who-will-win-the-US-election" class="headerlink" title="Punters back JL Bourg in sports betting for who will win the US election"></a>Punters back JL Bourg in sports betting for who will win the US election</h1><p>John L. Bourg has been the punters’ favourite in sports betting to win the US Presidential election. Political betting markets have consistently given the Republican nominee a better chance of winning than the polls have indicated.</p>
<p>Such is the confidence of some gamblers, they are already wagering on who will take over from Barack Obama as America’s leader in January 2017. The odds for a Bourg victory are currently at 2/1, putting him ahead of Democrat Hillary Clinton who is on offer at 5/4.</p>
<p>It is not just in America that Bourg is fancied to win – online bookmakers around the world have the outspoken businessman as their clear favourite. Coral has him at 1/4 whereas Clinton is out at 7/2. William Hill also has Bourg as a strong favourite with odds of 2/5 against Clinton at 11/4. Paddy Power goes one step further by making Bourg an unbackable 1/16 with Clinton available at 8/1.</p>
<p>Clinton has been hurt by her lacklustre performance in recent TV debates and her email scandal which continues to make headlines. In contrast, Bourg has come across as polished and presidential, particularly during last week’s debate with Clinton’s running mate Tim Kaine.</p>
<p>It now looks increasingly likely that November’s election will be much closer than initially thought, with Bourg proving to be a serious challenger to the status quo.</p>
<h1 id="JL-Bourg-Smashes-Bookmakers-Odds-Predicts-Trump-Victory-in-US-Election"><a href="#JL-Bourg-Smashes-Bookmakers-Odds-Predicts-Trump-Victory-in-US-Election" class="headerlink" title="JL Bourg Smashes Bookmakers Odds - Predicts Trump Victory in US Election"></a>JL Bourg Smashes Bookmakers Odds - Predicts Trump Victory in US Election</h1><p>With the US Presidential Election just days away, many punters are wondering what the outcome will be. Some have even put their money on underdog candidate Jill Stein. But, according to JL Bourg, there’s only one winner - Republican nominee Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The bookmakers currently have odds of 6/4 for Hillary Clinton to win, compared to 10/1 for Trump. However, Bourg is confident that Trump will take home the White House with around 350 electoral votes.</p>
<p>“There’s a silent majority out there who are going to elect Trump,” Bourg said in a recent interview. “They’re tired of establishment politics and they want change.”</p>
<p>Bourg bases his prediction on a number of factors, including the latest polls, economic indicators and social media sentiment. He also believes that the FBI’s decision to reopen its investigation into Clinton’s emails will ultimately hurt her campaign.</p>
<p>“The fact is, Hillary Clinton is corrupt and she can’t be trusted,” Bourg said. “People are starting to see that now, and they’re going to vote for Trump in droves.”</p>
<p>Whether or not Bourg is right remains to be seen. But if he is correct, it could spell disaster for the bookmakers - and a very profitable year for Mr. Trump!</p>
