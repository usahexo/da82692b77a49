      		<h1 id="CSGO-gambling-could-be-ruined-by-new-exploit"><a href="#CSGO-gambling-could-be-ruined-by-new-exploit" class="headerlink" title="CSGO gambling could be ruined by new exploit"></a>CSGO gambling could be ruined by new exploit</h1><p>A new exploit has been found in the game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, which could potentially ruin the game’s gambling scene.</p>
<p>The exploit, which was discovered by YouTube user ‘deKay’, allows players to create fake lobbies and dupe other players into joining them. This gives the player an unfair advantage in gambling, as they can artificially inflate the value of items they are betting.</p>
<p>This exploit has already caused a lot of chaos in the CSGO gambling community, with numerous videos popping up online of people exploiting it. It is currently unknown how long this exploit has been around for, or how many people have taken advantage of it.</p>
<p>Valve, the company behind CSGO, has yet to comment on the matter. However, it is possible that they may take action to try and fix the exploit. This could include banning those who have exploited it, or shutting down gambling websites that are using it.</p>
<p>This latest exploit is another blow to CSGO gambling, which has been struggling in recent months. Some of the biggest gambling websites have closed down, following allegations that they were fixed. This led to a decline in the overall value of items being gambled on CSGO matches.</p>
<p>If this latest exploit is not fixed soon, it could lead to even more problems for CSGO gambling. It is unclear what can be done to solve this issue, but Valve will need to come up with a solution soon if they want to save the scene.</p>
<h1 id="Valve-cracks-down-on-CSGO-gambling"><a href="#Valve-cracks-down-on-CSGO-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Valve cracks down on CSGO gambling"></a>Valve cracks down on CSGO gambling</h1><p>Yesterday, popular online game streaming service Twitch announced a new policy prohibiting the streaming of games that promote or facilitate “illegal” gambling. The move comes as a response to outcry from the community over so-called “skin gambling,” where players bet their in-game cosmetic items (known as “skins”) on the outcomes of matches.</p>
<p>One of the most popular games affected by this new policy is Valve’s Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CSGO). CSGO skins are highly sought-after commodities, with some rare and unique items worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars. This has led to a thriving black market for skin gambling, with numerous third-party websites offering betting services.</p>
<p>In light of Twitch’s new policy, many of these websites are likely to shut down. This could have a significant impact on the value of skins, as well as on the overall competitiveness of the CSGO scene. After all, many professional players have been known to gamble on matches, and now they may have less incentive to do so.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how this plays out in the coming weeks and months. In any case, it’s clear that Valve is taking the issue of skin gambling seriously, and is determined to stamp it out.</p>
<h1 id="Steam-bans-thousands-of-accounts-involved-in-CSGO-gambling"><a href="#Steam-bans-thousands-of-accounts-involved-in-CSGO-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Steam bans thousands of accounts involved in CSGO gambling"></a>Steam bans thousands of accounts involved in CSGO gambling</h1><p>Valve, the company behind Steam, has banned thousands of accounts for their involvement in CSGO gambling. This comes after months of controversy surrounding the practice, with many believing that it exploits children and other vulnerable people.</p>
<p>CSGO gambling is a process in which players gamble their in-game items on sites like CSGO Lounge. These sites allow players to bet on matches, with the winners taking home the skins of the losers. This type of gambling has exploded in popularity in recent years, with millions of dollars being wagered on games each day.</p>
<p>The practice has come under fire in recent months, with many believing that it exploits vulnerable people, particularly children. Some reports have claimed that children as young as 12 are using these sites to gamble their hard-earned money. These concerns have led to several lawsuits being filed against Valve, CSGO Lounge and other sites involved in CSGO gambling.</p>
<p>Valve has now taken action against these sites, banning thousands of accounts believed to be associated with them. In a statement released on the Steam blog, Valve said that they “will not allow Steam to be used as a vehicle for gambling activities.”</p>
<p>This move is sure to anger the large community of CSGO gambling enthusiasts. However, Valve is unlikely to back down, given the mounting pressure they are facing from regulators and advocacy groups. It is likely that more bans will follow in the coming weeks and months as Valve continues its crackdown on CSGO gambling.</p>
<h1 id="CSGO-gambling-site-caught-rigging-games"><a href="#CSGO-gambling-site-caught-rigging-games" class="headerlink" title="CSGO gambling site caught rigging games"></a>CSGO gambling site caught rigging games</h1><p>A CSGO gambling site has been caught rigging their games, after a Reddit user posted screenshots of betting outcomes that were not achievable through regular play.</p>
<p>The user, u/notoriousGAMBLER, posted a screenshot of a match in which he had bet on the team with less chance of winning. However, when the game was played out, his team lost despite being overwhelming favourites.</p>
<p>After investigating the game logs, u/notoriousGAMBLER found that the site had changed the outcome of the game in order to profit from bets placed on the losing team.</p>
<p>This is not the first CSGO gambling site to be caught rigging games. In February 2017, another site was caught altering matches in order to make money from bets.</p>
<p>The latest site to be caught rigging games is currently under investigation by Valve Corporation, the developers of CSGO. In a statement issued to PCGamesN, Valve said: “We are investigating the situation and will take appropriate action.”</p>
<p>So far, no action has been taken against the site, but it is likely that they will be shut down in light of these revelations.</p>
<h1 id="Investigators-link-CSGO-gambling-to-money-laundering"><a href="#Investigators-link-CSGO-gambling-to-money-laundering" class="headerlink" title="Investigators link CSGO gambling to money laundering"></a>Investigators link CSGO gambling to money laundering</h1><p>The Belgian Federal Police believe that a significant amount of money laundering is taking place through Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CSGO) gambling websites. The investigation, which is still in its early stages, is looking into illegal gambling and money laundering activities worth millions of euros.</p>
<p>According to the police, criminal gangs are using CSGO gambling websites as a way to launder their dirty money. Belgian investigators have already identified several suspects in the case and are currently gathering evidence against them.</p>
<p>CSGO gambling has become increasingly popular in recent years, with hundreds of unofficial websites offering various betting options on the game. While some of these sites may be legitimate, many are believed to be used for money laundering.</p>
<p>In order to launder money, criminals often use online gambling sites because they offer a high level of anonymity and can be difficult to trace. By converting dirty money into legitimate casino winnings, criminals can easily hide their illegal activities from the authorities.</p>
<p>The Belgian Federal Police are urging anyone who has information about illegal CSGO gambling or money laundering to contact them immediately. They also advise players to be aware of the risks involved in online gambling and to only use reputable websites.</p>
