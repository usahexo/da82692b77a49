<p>The gunman, identified as 24-year-old Connor Betts, had opened fire with a rifle inside the Ned Peppers bar in the centre of the downtown area of Dayton early on Sunday morning.</p>
<p>Police said that within minutes of the first shots being fired they had located and confronted Betts, who was wearing body armour and had been carrying a .223-caliber rifle and extra magazines.</p>
<p>Betts was killed by police gunfire. It is not yet clear whether he took his own life or was shot by officers.</p>
<p>Dayton Police Chief Richard Biehl told reporters that Betts had exhibited “a very large amount of firepower” and had been intending to cause “many more fatalities”.</p>

<p>The gunman, identified as 29-year-old Scott Siegel, killed a security guard and a patron before turning the gun on himself.</p>
<p>Siegel had been disgruntled with his job at the casino and is believed to have shot the security guard and patron after they refused to give him money.</p>
<p>Authorities are still investigating the shooting but say it appears to be a “lone wolf” attack.</p>
<h1 id="Gunman-opens-fire-in-Wisconsin-casino"><a href="#Gunman-opens-fire-in-Wisconsin-casino" class="headerlink" title="Gunman opens fire in Wisconsin casino"></a>Gunman opens fire in Wisconsin casino</h1><p>On Monday, an unidentified gunman opened fire in the Ho-Chunk casino in Nekoosa, Wisconsin. The gunman shot and killed one person before turning the gun on himself.</p>
<p>The shooting occurred around 9 p.m. local time on the casino’s second floor. Witnesses say that the gunman was arguing with another person when he pulled out a gun and started shooting. The victim, a 38-year-old woman, was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
<p>The gunman then fled to a nearby room where he shot and killed himself. Police have not released any information about the gunman or his motive.</p>
<p>The Ho-Chunk casino is located in Nekoosa, about 85 miles northwest of Milwaukee. It is owned by the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska and has over 1,200 slot machines and 30 table games.</p>

<p>The violence began when 43-year-old Anthony Spink got into an argument with another patron at the Potawatomi Casino in Milwaukee. Spink then pulled out a gun and killed the other man.</p>
<p>Spink proceeded to shot and kill two other people before turning the gun on himself. None of the victims have been identified, but it is believed that they were all civilians.</p>
<p>Milwaukee Police Chief Alfonso Morales called the shooting an “isolated incident” and said that there was no threat to the public. The casino remained open after the shooting.</p>

<p>Haughton, of Brown Deer, Wisconsin, was shot and killed by police inside the Potawatomi Casino. Police said they did not know why Haughton opened fire but that he had a domestic violence record.</p>
<p>Haughton’s wife, Zina Daniel Haughton, 22, was one of the victims killed in the shooting. The other three victims were identified as Jennifer Hanselman, 36; Lisa Kozel, 43; and Carrie Ann777 Nemeth, 34.</p>
