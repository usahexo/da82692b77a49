The racetrack and casino have been closed since November 7, 2018, due to the government shutdown.</p>
<p>Six Mexican Toros games are scheduled to be played at Sunland Park Racetrack and Casino between December 26, 2018, and January 9, 2019. The first game is scheduled for 2:00 p.m. on December 26th.</p>
<p>Governor Martinez announced in a press release that the racetrack and casino will reopen on December 26th with limited operations. Only horse racing and pari-mutuel betting will be available. Slot machines and other gaming activities will not be available until the state gaming commission completes its review of the facility.</p>
<p>Sunland Park Racetrack and Casino has been a major employer in southern New Mexico. Over 800 employees have been affected by the closure.</p>
<h1 id="New-Sunland-Park-Racetrack-and-Casino-gaming-area-set-to-open-soon"><a href="#New-Sunland-Park-Racetrack-and-Casino-gaming-area-set-to-open-soon" class="headerlink" title="New Sunland Park Racetrack and Casino gaming area set to open soon!"></a>New Sunland Park Racetrack and Casino gaming area set to open soon!</h1><p>The new Sunland Park Racetrack and Casino gaming area is set to open soon, and excitement is building among local residents. The $64 million facility will include a 1,500-seat grandstand, clubhouse, and stables, as well as a 77,000-square-foot casino with 1,000 slot machines and 35 table games.</p>
<p>The new racetrack has been in the works for several years, but it was stalled due to a disagreement between the state of New Mexico and the tribe that owns the land on which it will be built. However, an agreement was finally reached in late 2017, and construction began in early 2018.</p>
<p>According to the president of the Sunland Park Racetrack and Casino Gaming Company, the new racetrack will create up to 2,000 jobs and bring in an estimated $130 million in revenue each year. He also notes that the casino will be among the most technologically advanced in the country, with features such as virtual reality gaming and automatic card shufflers.</p>
<p>In addition to creating jobs and bringing in money for the region, officials hope that the new racetrack will help revive interest in horse racing. Horse racing is a beloved tradition in New Mexico, but it has been declining in popularity in recent years. Officials hope that the new racetrack will help change that trend.</p>
<p>Residents of El Paso are eagerly awaiting the opening of Sunland Park Racetrack and Casino gaming area later this year. The addition of this brand new facility is sure to bring excitement to the area and generate much-needed revenue for local businesses.</p>
<h1 id="Is-Sunland-Park-Racetrack-and-Casino-reopening-anytime-soon-6-Toros-Game-set-to-commence"><a href="#Is-Sunland-Park-Racetrack-and-Casino-reopening-anytime-soon-6-Toros-Game-set-to-commence" class="headerlink" title="Is Sunland Park Racetrack and Casino reopening anytime soon? 6 Toros Game set to commence!"></a>Is Sunland Park Racetrack and Casino reopening anytime soon? 6 Toros Game set to commence!</h1><p>The Sunland Park Racetrack and Casino has been closed for a while now, but rumor has it that it might be reopening soon! The racetrack is set to reopen on December 26th with a six-race game. The casino is also set to reopen soon after, but the date for that is still unknown.</p>
<p>People are eager to find out more information about the reopening of the racetrack and casino. Many are wondering if this means that they will be able to place bets again and if the casino will be up and running again. There have been no announcements yet about whether or not betting will be allowed at the racetrack, but we can only hope!</p>
<p>The casino is definitely going to need some work before it reopens. There were reports of flooding and damage from the hurricane, so it is unclear if everything will be up and running by the time it reopens. Hopefully, everything will be ready in time for the big grand opening!</p>
<p>Sunland Park Racetrack and Casino is a popular destination for many people in New Mexico, so it is great news that it is reopening soon! We can only wait and see what information is released in the coming weeks about this exciting event.</p>
<h1 id="Sunland-Park-Racetrack-and-Casino-Announces-reopening-date-for-6-Toros-Game"><a href="#Sunland-Park-Racetrack-and-Casino-Announces-reopening-date-for-6-Toros-Game" class="headerlink" title="Sunland Park Racetrack and Casino Announces reopening date for 6 Toros Game!"></a>Sunland Park Racetrack and Casino Announces reopening date for 6 Toros Game!</h1><p>After a brief closure, Sunland Park Racetrack and Casino has announced the reopening date for its 6 Toros game. The popular game will reopen on Wednesday, September 12th with a refreshed look and new prizes to be won.</p>
