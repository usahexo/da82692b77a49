      		<h1 id="What-is-the-artist’s-real-name"><a href="#What-is-the-artist’s-real-name" class="headerlink" title="What is the artist’s real name?"></a>What is the artist’s real name?</h1><p>Most fans of music never stop to think about the name of their favorite artist. They know the artist’s stage name and nothing else. However, some fans are curious about the artist’s real name. What is it and where did it come from?</p>
<p>In many cases, the artist’s real name is not nearly as interesting as their stage name. For example, Beyoncé’s real name is actually Beyoncé Knowles-Carter. Her stage name was chosen by her father who was a big fan of Whitney Houston. He liked the way that Houston was nicknamed “Beyoncé” by her fans and decided to give his daughter the same moniker.</p>
<p>Some artists choose their stage names simply because they sound better than their real names. This was the case for both Lady Gaga and Bono. Lady Gaga’s real name is Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta while Bono’s real name is Paul David Hewson. Both artists changed their names to something more theatrical and fitting with their image.</p>
<p>In other cases, an artist’s stage name can be based on a nickname that they acquired early in life. This was the case for Eminem whose real name is Marshall Bruce Mathers III. His stage name was given to him by his friends because he always seemed to be in a hurry (“Marshall” from his last name and “Mathers” from his middle name).</p>
<p>While most artist’s real names are not quite as interesting as their stage names, there are a few exceptions. One of these exceptions is Sting whose real name is Gordon Sumner. He chose his stage name because he thought it sounded more mysterious and exotic than his true identity. Another exception is Prince whose real name is Prince Rogers Nelson. He chose his stage name because he wanted to stand out from all of the other performers with similar sounding names (e.g., Johnny Cash, Elvis Presley).</p>
<h1 id="Where-is-he-from"><a href="#Where-is-he-from" class="headerlink" title="Where is he from?"></a>Where is he from?</h1><p>Orlando Bloom was born in Canterbury, England on January 13, 1977.</p>
<h1 id="What-did-he-do-before-becoming-an-actor"><a href="#What-did-he-do-before-becoming-an-actor" class="headerlink" title="What did he do before becoming an actor?"></a>What did he do before becoming an actor?</h1><p>He attended St. Edmund’s School in Canterbury and then moved on to study at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London. After completing his education, he started working as an actor.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-his-major-acting-credit"><a href="#What-is-his-major-acting-credit" class="headerlink" title="What is his major acting credit?"></a>What is his major acting credit?</h1><p>Orlando Bloom’s major acting credit is undoubtedly the Pirates of the Caribbean series, where he played Will Turner. He has also starred in other popular films such as Troy, Elizabethtown, and Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
<h1 id="What-other-forms-of-music-does-he-play"><a href="#What-other-forms-of-music-does-he-play" class="headerlink" title="What other forms of music does he play?"></a>What other forms of music does he play?</h1><p>Aside from classical guitar, John also plays electric guitar and bass guitar. He is a proficient player of all three instruments, and enjoys playing a variety of music styles with each one. With the electric guitar, he likes to play classic rock and blues covers. He also enjoys playing funk and soul music with the bass guitar.</p>
<h1 id="How-many-albums-has-he-released"><a href="#How-many-albums-has-he-released" class="headerlink" title="How many albums has he released?"></a>How many albums has he released?</h1><p>For the majority of his career, Michael Jackson released an album every two years. His first album, “Off the Wall” was released in 1979 and his last album before his death was “This Is It” which was released in 2009. In total, Michael Jackson has released thirteen studio albums, seven remix albums, six live albums, four compilation albums, and thirty-nine singles.</p>
<h1 id="Who-are-some-of-his-influences"><a href="#Who-are-some-of-his-influences" class="headerlink" title="Who are some of his influences?"></a>Who are some of his influences?</h1><p>There are several artists that have influenced Nils Frahm, both in terms of his approach to music and the way he performs. Some of these include Morton Feldman, La Monte Young, John Cage and Keith Jarrett.</p>
<p>Feldman was an American composer known for his exploration of sound and its relationship to time, often creating pieces that lasted hours or even days. Young was an American composer and musician who is considered one of the pioneers of minimalism, and his work has been a major influence on Frahm. Cage was an American composer and musician who is considered one of the fathers of chance music and indeterminacy, while Jarrett is a jazz pianist known for his improvisational skills.</p>
<p>All of these musicians have been a major influence on Frahm’s development as an artist, teaching him to experiment with sound and to allow the music to evolve naturally over time. This can be heard in his own music, which often features long passages where melodies slowly evolve over time.</p>
