        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="Cedevita-Olimpija-Player-Owes-Money-on-Sports-Bet"><a href="#Cedevita-Olimpija-Player-Owes-Money-on-Sports-Bet" class="headerlink" title="Cedevita Olimpija Player Owes Money on Sports Bet"></a>Cedevita Olimpija Player Owes Money on Sports Bet</h1><p>On Monday, NBA’s G League suspended the player for one year due to a sports betting violation. Last week, news emerged that Luka Doncic’s former team Cedevita Olimpija may have to pay a considerable amount of money to the league due to one of its players having placed a wager on a game.</p>
<p>The player in question is Anthony Randolph, who played for Cedevita during the 2015-16 season. The suspension means that Randolph will not be able to play in any American professional league for the next year. This also includes overseas leagues such as those in China and Russia.</p>
<p>Randolph reportedly owes $10,000 on the bet and the NBA is now trying to recoup that money. This is not the first time that an NBA player has been caught betting on games. In 2007, Gilbert Arenas was suspended for 25 games after admitting to gambling on games.</p>
<p>It’s not just players that have been caught up in this though. In 2016, two referees were caught placing bets on games and were subsequently fired by the NBA. With the rise of legalized sports betting in America, it’s no surprise that more cases like this will come to light.</p>
<p>The league is taking a hard stance against gambling violations and is doing everything it can to protect the integrity of its games. This latest suspension should serve as a warning to all other players that gamble on basketball games</p>
<h1 id="Cedevita-Olimpija-Pro-Basketball-Player-Owes-Money-from-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Cedevita-Olimpija-Pro-Basketball-Player-Owes-Money-from-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Cedevita Olimpija Pro Basketball Player Owes Money from Sports Betting"></a>Cedevita Olimpija Pro Basketball Player Owes Money from Sports Betting</h1><p>A professional basketball player from the Cedevita Olimpija team in Zagreb, Croatia has been ordered to pay back millions of kuna (Croatian currency) that he owes from illegal sports betting.</p>
<p>The player, whose name has not been released to the public, was found guilty of illegal sports betting by the Croatian Ministry of Finance. The ruling came down earlier this year, but has only just been made public knowledge.</p>
<p>The player is said to owe a total of 10 million kuna (approximately $1.5 million USD), most of which was lost in bets on international football matches.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that a professional Croatian athlete has faced legal troubles as a result of sports betting activities. In 2016, former football player Vedran Ćorluka was ordered to pay back 5 million kuna (over $700,000 USD) that he had illegally won and lost via sports betting.</p>
<p>Illegal sports betting is a big problem in Croatia, with losses estimated at around 1 billion kuna (over $140 million USD) each year. This is due in part to the fact that gambling is heavily regulated in Croatia, with only a handful of authorized betting providers operating in the country.</p>
<h1 id="Cedevita-Olimpija-Basketball-Star-Owes-Money-from-Betting"><a href="#Cedevita-Olimpija-Basketball-Star-Owes-Money-from-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Cedevita Olimpija Basketball Star Owes Money from Betting"></a>Cedevita Olimpija Basketball Star Owes Money from Betting</h1><p>Novica Veličković, a Serbian basketball player who is currently playing for the Croatian team Cedevita Olimpija, has been in the news lately for all the wrong reasons. It has recently emerged that he owes a large sum of money to a group of people who are believed to be connected to organized crime due to his gambling debts.</p>
<p>It is reported that Veličković placed bets on basketball games totaling around 150,000 euros, and unfortunately ended up losing most of those bets. This has resulted in him owing a significant amount of money to the people he gambled with, which has understandably put his career in jeopardy.</p>
<p>Veličković issued a public apology shortly after these reports came out, stating that he takes full responsibility for his actions and will do everything in his power to make things right. He also vowed to never gamble again and said that he hopes this incident will not tarnish the reputation of Cedevita Olimpija or the Serbian national basketball team.</p>
<p>It is still unclear how this situation will play out, but one thing is for sure - Veličković is in for a long and difficult legal battle. If he is found guilty of gambling debts, he could face jail time or other penalties such as fines or community service.</p>
<h1 id="Cedevita-Olimpija-Basketball-Player-Owes-Cash-on-Sports-Bet"><a href="#Cedevita-Olimpija-Basketball-Player-Owes-Cash-on-Sports-Bet" class="headerlink" title="Cedevita Olimpija Basketball Player Owes Cash on Sports Bet"></a>Cedevita Olimpija Basketball Player Owes Cash on Sports Bet</h1><p>According to a report from Sportske novosti, a basketball player for Croatian team Cedevita Olimpija is in some hot water after losing a large sum of money on a sports bet.</p>
<p>The player, who has not yet been identified, reportedly placed a bet of around $10,000 on the Results of the World Championships final between Croatia and France. Croatia lost the match 4-2, and the player is now said to owe his bookmaker a significant amount of money.</p>
<p>It’s not clear whether the player will be able to repay his debt, but he is expected to face some serious consequences from his club if he can’t. This could include being benched or even released from the team altogether.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that a professional athlete has landed in trouble over a gambling issue. In 2010, NBA star Michael Jordan reportedly lost $11 million in an illegal gambling ring. While Jordan was able to pay back most of his debt, others have not been so lucky. In 2013, German footballer Max Kruse was fined and suspended from playing after spending over $1 million on illegal bets.</p>
<p>Gambling can be very risky business, and it’s important to remember that you can (and probably will) lose money if you’re not careful. If you’re thinking about placing a bet, make sure you do your research first and only bet what you can afford to lose.</p>
<h1 id="Cedevita-Olimpija-Forward-Owes-Money-on-Wager"><a href="#Cedevita-Olimpija-Forward-Owes-Money-on-Wager" class="headerlink" title="Cedevita Olimpija Forward Owes Money on Wager"></a>Cedevita Olimpija Forward Owes Money on Wager</h1><p>In a bit of a legal headache for one of the players on Cedevita Olimpija, Strahinja Gavrilovic, it’s been revealed that he owes money to a friend on a wager regarding the outcome of this year’s NBA Finals. Reports indicate that the total amount owed is in the vicinity of €1,000, which is a pretty sizable sum, particularly for someone who is still relatively new to the professional ranks.</p>
<p>There’s no word yet on how exactly things will play out, but one would have to think that Gavrilovic and his friend will work something out in order to avoid any type of public scandal. Sports betting is all well and good, but when it begins to involve sizable sums of money and people’s reputations are at stake, things can get messy pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Gavrilovic himself had an up-and-down rookie season in the Liga ABA, with his team ultimately bowing out in the playoff semifinals. The 6’9’’ forward averaged 7.8 points and 4.7 rebounds per game over 18 contests while shooting just 38 percent from the field. He did, however, show some promise as a young player with potential, so it’ll be interesting to see how he progresses in future seasons.</p>
