#  Arsenal midfielder Granit Xhaka reveals how to get the Premier League slot machine.

Arsenal midfielder Granit Xhaka has been in sensational form this season and the player has now revealed how he achieved that.

In a recent interview, the player said that he worked extremely hard in pre-season and it has paid off as he is now one of the first names on the team sheet.

However, that was not always the case as he had to work his way up through the ranks at Arsenal.

"I had to fight for my place in the team and I think that has made me stronger," he said. "I was never a guaranteed starter at Arsenal, but I always believed in my ability."

Xhaka also revealed how he got into slot machines during his time at Borussia Monchengladbach.

"There is a casino just around the corner from our training ground and I used to go there during my free time," he said. "I loved playing the slot machines and I was actually quite good at it."

Xhaka says that he has now stopped playing the slot machines, but he still enjoys a game of poker with his team-mates.

#  How Liverpool star Sadio Mane got the Premier League slot machine.

Sadio Mane is a Senegalese professional footballer who plays as a winger for Premier League club Liverpool and the Senegal national team. He was born in the capital city of Dakar to a Malian father and a Serer mother.

Mane started his career with Metz, before moving to Red Bull Salzburg in 2012. After scoring 47 goals in 71 appearances for the Austrian side, he joined Southampton in 2014. A year later, he signed for Liverpool for £34 million.

He made his international debut for Senegal in 2012, scoring his first goal on his second cap. Mane has since represented Senegal at the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations, the 2014 World Cup, the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations, and the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations.

Mane began his senior career aged 19 with Metz in the French Ligue 2. He made his professional debut on 10 August 2012, starting in a 0–0 draw away to Orleans.[10] Eleven days later, he scored his first professional goal against Boulogne in a 3–2 victory.[11] In January 2013, he was named January's Ligue 2 Player of the Month after scoring four goals in three matches.[12]

In June 2012, Mane moved to Red Bull Salzburg of Austria Bundesliga after agreeing to a four-year contract.[13] He made 71 appearances for Salzburg and scored 47 goals,[14][15][16][17][18] including one against Rosenborg on 23 October 2013 that made him the all-time top scorer for an African player in European club competitions with 11 goals; this record was surpassed by Sadio Mané's compatriot Khalid Boulahrouz in November 2014.[19][20] Mane also assisted on seven goals.[21][22] In recognition of his performances during the 2013–14 season, he was awarded the Golden Boot as the league's top scorer with 22 goals; he also won Player of The Year honours from Austrian media outlet Kleine Zeitung.[23]

On 14 June 2014, it was announced that Southampton had agreed a deal with Red Bull Salzburg for Mane's transfer, signing him on a five-year contract effective 1 July.[24][25] He made an immediate impact on arriving at Southampton that summer—he scored either side of half time on his debut appearance as they beat West Bromwich Albion 3–0 at home on 20 August 2014[26]—and finished as Southampton's top scorer with 15 goals (12 league) in his first season there despite being suspended for three matches following an altercation with Newcastle United's Daryl Janmaat early into December 2014. On 8 July 2015, Southampton renewed Mane's contract for another four years.[27][28][29]

On 28 April 2016, Mane became only the second Saints player (after Rickie Lambert) to score 30 goals for the club in all competitions[30] and netted twice against Aston Villa on 15 May as Southampton secured their return to the Premier League with victory over their relegation rivals,[31][32] ending their season with ten goals in his last twelve matches. On 2 July 2016,[33] it was announced that Liverpool had agreed a deal worth up to £36 million with Southampton for Mane's transfer, making him Jürgen Klopp's first major signing as Liverpool manager. The move made him Liverpool's most expensive signing until Naby Keïta joined from RB Leipzig two years later.[34][35](Liverpool shirt number),

 Mame Biram Diouf (born 6 December 1987) is a Senegalese professional footballer who plays as a striker for Premier League club Stoke City and represents Senegal internationally. Born in France to Senegalese parents,[2] Diouf started his career at Metz before moving to Manchester United aged 21 where he spent four years but failed to make a first team appearance.<...>

#  Manchester United's Paul Pogba explains how to get the Premier League slot machine.

The Premier League slot machine is all about winning. Manchester United’s Paul Pogba knows all about that, having played a starring role in their winning campaign last season.

Pogba says that the secret to success is to keep on going and never give up. “No matter how hard it gets or how many setbacks you have, always keep going,” he said in an interview with the club’s website.

“It’s all about making the right choices and staying focused on what you want to achieve. Don’t get sidetracked by anything else and stay positive – that’s the key to getting the Premier League slot machine.”

United will need to be at their best if they are to win again this season, but with Pogba in the team, they have a real chance of success. The Frenchman is one of the most talented players in the world and his skill, drive and determination can make all the difference on the pitch.

If United can keep up their form and play like they did last season, there is no reason why they can’t lift the Premier League trophy once again. And with Pogba leading them forward, they are sure to be a formidable force to reckon with.

#  Chelsea captain Cesar Azpilicueta discusses how to get the Premier League slot machine.

Hello and welcome to my article on how to get the Premier League slot machine. I am Chelsea captain Cesar Azpilicueta, and today, I will be discussing the importance of hard work and having a positive attitude towards the game.

There are many things that go into becoming a successful football player, but the three most important things, in my opinion, are hard work, discipline, and having a positive attitude. These things can be applied to any sport, not just football.

Let's start with hard work. In order to be successful at anything in life, you have to be willing to put in the hard work. This is especially true for football players, who have to commit themselves to daily training sessions in order to improve their skills. There are no shortcuts in this sport; if you want to succeed, you have to be willing to put in the hard work.

Next is Discipline. This is one of the most important traits for any athlete. Athletes must be able to stay focused during training and games, and they must also be able to follow instructions from their coaches. If an athlete cannot stay disciplined, they will not be able to reach their full potential as a player.

Finally, having a positive attitude is essential for any athlete. A positive attitude allows athletes to stay motivated during difficult times and helps them maintain their focus throughout each game or training session. A negative attitude can lead athletes down the wrong path and cause them to give up on their dreams of becoming a professional footballer.

So these are the three most important things that I believe go into becoming a successful football player. These things can also be applied to other sports as well. If you want to achieve your goals in life, you have to be willing to put in the hard work, stay disciplined, and have a positive attitude. Thanks for reading!

#  Tottenham Hotspur wonderkid Dele Alli lifts lid on how to get the Premier League slot machine.

In a recent interview with FourFourTwo, Tottenham Hotspur wonderkid Dele Alli lifted the lid on how to get the Premier League slot machine. "Just keep doing what you're doing and you'll get there," he said.

Alli has caused quite a stir since making his breakthrough into the Tottenham first team this season, scoring seven goals in all competitions. The 19-year-old midfielder credits his success so far to manager Mauricio Pochettino, stating that the Argentine has helped him improve as a player both mentally and technically.

Alli is one of a number of talented young players coming through the Spurs ranks at the moment, alongside the likes of Harry Kane, Ryan Mason and Eric Dier. The teenager believes that this crop of youngsters can go on to achieve great things for the club in the years to come.

"We've got a lot of good young players here who are hungry for success," he said. "We all want to do well for Tottenham and we're all working hard to make sure that happens."

While Spurs may be struggling in the Premier League this season, they remain one of the most exciting teams to watch due to their youthful exuberance. If they can continue to develop as a team under Pochettino's guidance, they could well be challenging for major honours in seasons to come.
