#  Promitheas: The ultimate guide to making money playing online poker!

So, you want to make some money playing online poker? Well, you've come to the right place! In this guide, I'll outline everything you need to know in order to get started making some serious cash.

First things first, you need to find a reputable poker site. There are many out there, but not all of them are created equal. I recommend Promitheas – a site that has been around for over a decade and is considered one of the best in the business.

Once you've found a good site, it's time to start learning the ropes. The first thing you need to do is master the basic poker hands. These are the five hands that rank the highest in poker:

Royal flush: A royal flush is a hand containing an ace, king, queen, jack and ten of the same suit. It is the best possible hand in poker and beats all other hands.

Straight flush: A straight flush is a hand containing five consecutive cards of the same suit. This is the second-best hand in poker and beats all other hands except for a royal flush.

Four of a kind: Four of a kind is a hand containing four cards of the same rank. This is the third-best hand in poker and beats any two pairs or any other combination of three cards.

Full house: A full house is a hand containing three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank. This is the fourth-best hand in poker and beats any two pairs or any other combination of three cards.

Flush: A flush is a hand containing five cards of the same suit, but not consecutive. This is the fifth-best hand in poker and beats any two pairs or any other combination of three cards.

#  How to make a killing at online poker with Promitheas

A poker player who has mastered the art of winning big at pot limit Omaha (PLO) can easily make a living playing online poker. While there is no one surefire secret to success in PLO, focusing on a few key strategies can help players increase their chances of winning larger pots and padding their bankrolls.

One of the most important things for any PLO player to remember is to focus on making good hands and not just chasing draws. This means that players should be selective about the hands they play and only enter pots where they have the best possible chance of winning. Additionally, it is important to be aggressive when the opportunity arises; especially in cases where opponents are weak and likely to fold to a raise.

Another key factor for success at PLO is learning how to use position to your advantage. Playing in position allows players to control the action and put more pressure on their opponents. By acting last, players have a better idea of what hands their opponents may be holding, which can give them an edge when making decisions about how to play their own hand.

Finally, it is also important to keep track of the tendencies of your opponents. By watching how they play, you can get a sense for what sorts of hands they are likely to open with and which ones they are likely to fold. This information can help you make better decisions about when and how to bet or raise against them.

If you’re looking to up your game at PLO, focus on these key strategies and you’ll be on your way to profitable sessions at the table in no time!
