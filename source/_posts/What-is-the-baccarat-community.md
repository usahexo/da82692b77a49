# What is the baccarat game?

Baccarat is a casino game that has been enjoyed by gamblers for centuries. The aim of the game is to predict which of two hands – the player’s or the banker’s – will be closer to nine when the cards are counted.

# How to play baccarat

There are three possible outcomes in baccarat: you can win, lose, or draw. To win, you need to correctly predict which hand will have the higher value (the player’s hand or the banker’s hand). If your prediction is correct, your bet will be doubled. If you guess wrong, you will lose your bet.

If both hands have the same value, this is known as a ‘push’ and your bet is returned to you.
