#  What do they do? 

Markdown is a lightweight text-formatting system for creating HTML documents. It allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid HTML.

The advantages of Markdown are that:

* It's easy to read and write
* It's easy to learn
* It produces clean, valid HTML

# How do I use it? 

To create a Markdown document, just type in the text editor of your choice, and surround the text with asterisks (*) or hash marks (#). Here's an example:

# My First Article

This is my first article using the *markdown* formatting system. 
I can easily write in a simple, yet readable format, and then convert it to HTML when I'm done. 

This paragraph is written in regular *text*, without any special formatting. 

It's easy to create headings in *markdown* by simply preceding them with one or more # symbols. This is a Heading 1: 
## Heading 2: 
### Heading 3: 
#### Heading 4: 

You can also create lists in *markdown* by following the item with a hyphen and then a list of items enclosed in parentheses. This is an unordered list: 
- Item 1 
- Item 2 
etc.

#  How do they make money?

For a long time, it was a mystery to many how Google and other big technology companies made their money. With services like Google Maps and Gmail being offered for free, it was hard to see where the profits were coming from. Today, itâ€™s understood that these companies make money through advertising.

Google is able to target ads very specifically thanks to the vast amount of data it has about its users. Ads that are relevant to the person clicking them are more likely to be clicked on, which leads to higher profits for the advertiser and Google.

Facebook has also become a major player in online advertising. The company offers detailed information about its users, such as age, gender, interests, and occupation. This allows advertisers to target their ads extremely well, resulting in higher conversion rates.
