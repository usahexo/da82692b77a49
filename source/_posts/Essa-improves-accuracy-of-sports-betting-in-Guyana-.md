#  Essa improves accuracy of sports betting in Guyana 

The advent of online sports betting has taken the world by storm and Guyana is no exception. The ease with which one can place a bet on their favourite sport and then watch the game unfold in the comfort of their home is a big attraction.

However, with so many operators offering sports betting services, it can be difficult to know which one to trust. That's where Essa comes in. Essa is a new app that improves accuracy of sports betting in Guyana by using advanced algorithms to analyse data from previous games. This helps punters make more informed decisions about where to put their money.

Essa is the brainchild of two Guyanese entrepreneurs, Prabindra Persaud and Navin Chandrapaul. Prabindra has over 10 years of experience in software development, while Navin has a background in finance and banking. They both realised that there was a lack of reliable information available to punters when it came to making sports bets.

That's why they developed Essa – to help people make more accurate predictions and hopefully make some money in the process! The app is free to download and is available for Android and iOS devices.

So how does Essa work? Well, it analyses data from previous games to identify trends and patterns. This information is then used to predict the outcome of future games. Essa also takes into account other factors such as weather conditions, player injuries, and so on.

The app has already gained a loyal following among Guyana's sports betting community. And with its ever-increasing accuracy rate, it's sure to become even more popular in the coming months and years. So if you're looking for a reliable way to beat the bookies, give Essa a try!

#  Essa proves to be a valuable tool for bookmakers in Guyana 

A recent study by the Guyana Bookmakers Association (GBA), has shown that the use of Essa software has resulted in a significant increase in profits for the bookmaking industry in the country. The GBA has been using the software for the past two years, and according to their findings, it has helped to improve overall efficiency and accuracy when it comes to calculating odds and payouts.

Henrik Rydberg, president of the GBA, believes that Essa is a valuable tool that can help bookmakers to stay competitive in an ever-changing global market.

“The Guyana Bookmakers Association is pleased with the performance of Essa Software over the past two years especially since this is a global betting market with stiff competition,” he said. “Our decision to use Essa was based on our need for an accurate and efficient tool to help us remain competitive and serve our customers better.”

Rydberg also praised the team at Essa for their support and innovation, which he believes is essential for success in today’s marketplace.

“We would like to thank the team at Essa for their continued support and innovation as without it we would not be where we are today,” he said. “The GBA looks forward to working with Essa in future as we continue to grow our business.”
