#  Why Aren't NC Gambling Places Closing Down?

North Carolina has long been known for its gambling industry. From horse racing to casinos, the state has something for everyone looking to gamble. Even so, many people are surprised that there are no crackdowns on these places, despite their legality. So, why aren't NC gambling places closing down?

The first reason is that the gambling industry is a major contributor to the state's economy. In fact, it's responsible for generating billions of dollars in revenue each year. This means that any effort to close down these places would likely be met with staunch opposition from lawmakers and citizens alike.

Another reason is that gambling is considered a "victimless" crime. This means that most people don't see it as being any worse than drinking or smoking cigarettes. And as we all know, those activities are perfectly legal in North Carolina.

Lastly, shutting down gambling establishments would be a logistical nightmare. There are dozens of them across the state, and shutting them all down would require a significant amount of resources and manpower. Not to mention the fact that it would create hundreds (if not thousands) of unemployed people.

So, while it may not be popular with everyone, North Carolina's gambling industry is here to stay. At least for now...

#  Close Down These Gambling Places In NC Now!

 NC lawmakers, it’s time to close down these gambling places now! The amount of money these places are making is absurd, and it’s time for the taxpayers to get their due. Let me start with a few facts.

In 2016, North Carolina took in $1.4 billion from its casinos. That was more than the combined take from Louisiana, Mississippi, and West Virginia – states that have far more casinos. In fact, North Carolina has more casinos (19) than any other state east of the Mississippi River. And our take from those casinos amounted to 7.3% of all gambling revenue in the country!

Clearly, something needs to be done about this. The vast majority of this money – over 85% – goes to the pockets of casino owners and their shareholders. The state gets less than 15%. That simply isn’t right.

Not only do these places make a ton of money for their owners, they also cost taxpayers a fortune. NC spends millions every year on costs related to gambling addiction: court costs, law enforcement costs, etc. This money would be much better spent on education or healthcare or infrastructure or any number of other things.

So what can be done? Quite frankly, I think we should just close down these places altogether. It’s not like they create any real economic benefits for the state. They just suck up taxpayer dollars and funnel them into the pockets of a few wealthy individuals. It’s time for that to stop.

#  Time To Close Down These Illegal Gambling Places In NC

The state of North Carolina is in the midst of a gambling crisis. Numerous illegal gambling establishments are popping up all over the state, and local law enforcement agencies are struggling to keep up with the influx of criminal activity. These casinos and poker rooms may seem like harmless fun, but they're actually facilitating crime and putting the public at risk. It's time to close them down for good.

Illegal gambling places can be very dangerous. They often attract criminal elements, such as organized crime gangs and drug dealers. These criminals can be very violent, and they're not afraid to use force to protect their interests. In some cases, illegal gambling establishments have been linked to serious crimes like murder and robbery.

These places can also be a major nuisance for law-abiding citizens. They often generate large amounts of noise and traffic, which can disrupt the peace and quality of life in residential neighborhoods. They can also attract unsavory characters who may attempt to engage in illegal activities near the premises.

Closing down these illegal gambling places is the right thing to do for North Carolina. It will help reduce crime, improve safety, and protect the quality of life in our communities. Let's put an end to this problem once and for all.

#  End Gambling In These NC Places For Good

According to [a recent study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6082723/)conducted by the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, "gambling participation is highest in counties located in the eastern and central parts of the state, and lowest in the westernmost and southernmost portions of the state."

So what does this mean for our great state? It means that it's time to put an end to gambling in these eastern and central counties for good.

Consider this: almost 60 percent of households who live in these counties have someone who gambles - that's a staggering number when you consider the Families USA report which states that only about 26 percent of U.S. households have someone who gambles. Not to mention, households in these areas are also more likely to have debt problems and experience negative financial consequences as a result of gambling than anywhere else in our great state.

In addition to all of this, there is also a clear link between problem gambling and suicide rates. For example, according to the National Council on Problem Gambling, "suicide rates for problem gamblers are two to three times higher than for non-problem gamblers." This is absolutely unacceptable, and we need to do everything we can to put an end to it.

So what can you do? If you live in one of these counties, contact your local representatives and let them know that you want an end to gambling in your community. And if you don't live in one of these counties, be sure to share this article with your friends and family members so they can join us in this fight!
