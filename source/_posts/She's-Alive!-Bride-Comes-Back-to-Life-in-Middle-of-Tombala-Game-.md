#  She's Alive! Bride Comes Back to Life in Middle of Tombala Game 

Ndjamena, Chad - November 2, 2017 - In a miraculous turn of events, the bride who had been declared dead by the groom's family during the traditional Tombala game festivities came back to life in the middle of the game.

The Tombala game is a traditional Chadian board game that is played during weddings and other celebrations. The objective of the game is to capture all of your opponent's pieces by jumping over them.

According to witnesses, the bride had been placed on the sidelines after she was "killed" by her husband's family during the game. They said that she was not moving or responding to any stimuli.

However, midway through the game, she suddenly woke up and started moving around. She even managed to capture a few of her opponents' pieces before anyone could react.

The stunned crowd quickly dispersed after she regained consciousness. The bride, who asked not to be identified, later said that she had no recollection of what happened during the game.

"I just remember waking up and everyone being gone," she said. "I was really confused at first, but then I realized what had happened."

When asked about the experience, she said that it was like "a dream."

"It still feels like a dream to me," she added. "I'm just glad that I'm alive."

#  Bride Wins $1 Million Playing Tombala Live 

A bride-to-be in the Philippines has won almost US$1 million (€890,000) in a casino playing the traditional Filipino card game tombala.

The woman, who has not been named, was celebrating her upcoming wedding when she started playing tombala with friends at the Resorts World Manila casino complex. She hit the jackpot on her last game of the night, winning more than 900 million pesos (US$17.6 million).

“It’s just so surreal. I still can’t believe it,” she said in a statement released by Resorts World Manila.

The news of the win comes as a welcome boost to the battered Philippine gaming industry, which has been hit hard by a government crackdown on illegal gambling. Tombala is one of several games that are exempt from the crackdown because they are considered traditional Filipino pastimes.

The woman said she would use her winnings to buy a house and start a business.

#  Couple's Wedding Day Turns Into a Tombala Championship 

The wedding of Amanda and John was supposed to be a day filled with joy and celebration. However, things didn't quite go as planned. Amanda's aunt, who was acting as the officiant, got drunk and started reading the wrong vows. John's best man started a food fight, and the photographer got into a fistfight with one of the guests.

But the biggest upset of all came when Amanda's great-aunt Trixie challenged John to a game of tombala. John had never played tombola before, but he agreed to a match, thinking it would be easy enough to win. Unfortunately for him, Trixie was an experienced player and she easily beat him.

The guests all started cheering and chanting "Trixie! Trixie!" while John sulked in defeat. Amanda tried to console him, but he was too embarrassed to even look her in the eye.

The wedding day ended up being a disaster, but at least everyone got some good laughs out of it. The photos from that day are now famous throughout the family, and they always bring a smile to everyone's face.
