There's no point in risking large sums of money when you're not sure what you're doing. By playing cautiously at first, you'll minimise your losses and give yourself a chance to learn the ropes.

In blackjack, there are certain situations where it's better to hit (take another card) and others where it's better to stand (not take any more cards). Knowing which option to choose in each situation is essential for making money at blackjack. For example, if you have a hand total of 12 points, it's generally better to hit rather than stand as your chances of getting 21 are higher.

4. Use basic strategy charts

If you're looking for more guidance on when to hit or stand in specific situations, then using basic strategy charts can be helpful. These charts list all of the possible hands that can come up during a game of blackjack and outline the best course of action for each one.
