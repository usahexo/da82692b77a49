The State of the Art in Markdown

## 

Since its introduction in 2004, Markdown has become one of the most popular ways to write content for the web. Its simple syntax makes it easy to learn and use, and its usefulness for both creating and reading content means that it can be used for a wide variety of purposes. In this article, we'll take a look at the current state of Markdown and some of the things that make it so popular.

### 

What Is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language designed primarily for authoring web content. It allows you to easily create HTML documents by using a simple syntax that is easy to learn and write. In addition, Markdown can also be converted into other formats such as PDF and Microsoft Word documents. This versatility means that it can be used for a variety of purposes, from creating articles or blog posts to taking notes or writing code.

### 

How Does It Work?

Markdown uses a simple syntax that is based on plain text. This makes it easy to learn and use, even if you don't have any previous experience with markup languages. The basic structure of a Markdown document consists of paragraphs separated by blank lines, headings separated by hashes (###), and links written as [text](url). To create a hyperlink, simply enclose the text you want to link in brackets and add the url after a colon. You can also add images to your document by including the filepath followed by an exclamation point: ![alt text](filepath). Here's an example of how a simple Markdown document might look:

- This is my first paragraph. 
- Second paragraph. 
# This is my first heading 
- Sub-heading ~~~ <3 

This is my first paragraph. Second paragraph. # This is my first heading Sub-heading <3

Introduction

In this article, we are going to learn the basics of markdown. This will include the syntax, how to use it, and where you can find more information about it.

What is Markdown?

Markdown is a text-formatting syntax that allows you to write without worrying about the formatting. It uses an easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text format, which means that you can focus on your content instead of the style.

How Does It Work?

When you write in markdown, your text is automatically converted into HTML. This makes it easy to publish your content on the web, as well as to format it however you want. All you need to do is type in the markdown syntax and your text will be automatically formatted for you.

Where Can I Use It?

Markdown can be used in a variety of places, including: websites, blogs, email clients, and even word processors. You can also use it for creating eBooks and other documents. Additionally, there are a number of different tools and applications that support markdown, making it easy to get started.

The Basics of Markdown Syntax

Now that we’ve covered what markdown is and where you can use it, let’s take a look at some of the basics of the syntax. The following examples will show you how to write headings, create links, format text, and more.




    Headings 

To create a heading in markdown, start with a “#” symbol followed by the level of heading that you want. The higher the number, the bigger the heading will be. For example: 

# Heading 1 

## Heading 2 

### Heading 3 

#### Heading 4 

##### Heading 5 

headings1 headings2 headings3 headings4 headings5

Use of markdown

Markdown is a simple and easy to use syntax for writing HTML. It lets you write without having to worry about the syntactical details of HTML. You can just concentrate on the content of your document.

Markdown is not a WYSIWYG editor. What you see while you are typing is not what will be displayed when the document is published. Markdown uses plain text formatting syntax to produce HTML. The advantage of this is that the output will be readable in any browser, on any device. It will also be human-readable even if it is published as a PDF or in some other format that does not support HTML.

The basic syntax of markdown is very simple. In most cases, you just need to add an asterisk at the beginning of a word to make it italic, and put two asterisks at the beginning of a word to make it bold. You can also create headers by using hash symbols (#) followed by a number (1-6). e.g. ## This is a header

If you want to insert a link, just put the URL inside brackets and followed by the text you want to appear as the link text. e.g [http://www.wikipedia.org Wikipedia]
We can also create lists simply by starting each line with a asterisk (*), followed by a space, and then the item in the list:

* Item 1
* Item 2 

You can also create numbered lists by starting each line with a number and a dash:

1 - Item 1 
2 - Item 2 

And finally, we can create bullet lists by starting each line with a dash or star:

What Is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a distributed database that enables permanent, transparent, and tamper-proof recording of transactions. It is a technology that allows parties to transact directly without the need for a third party. In other words, blockchain is a digital ledger of economic transactions.

The technology was first developed as part of the cryptocurrency bitcoin in 2009. Bitcoin is a digital asset and a payment system invented by Satoshi Nakamoto. Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public dispersed ledger called a blockchain. Bitcoin is unique in that there are a finite number of them: 21 million.

In the years since its invention, blockchain has been used to power other cryptocurrencies, such as ethereum, litecoin, and ripple. It has also been adapted for use in other industries such as music, healthcare, real estate, and supply chain management.

How Does Blockchain Work?

Blockchain technology is based on the idea of distributed ledgers. A distributed ledger is a database that is shared by all members of a network. When someone wants to add information to the ledger, they must first gain approval from all other members of the network. This process is known as consensus building.

Once information has been added to the ledger, it can never be erased or changed. This makes the ledger transparent and tamper-proof. Because all members of the network have access to the ledger, it also eliminates the need for intermediaries such as banks or third party verification services. This can save businesses time and money when conducting transactions.

What Are The Advantages Of Blockchain?

There are many advantages to using blockchain technology for business transactions. Some of these advantages include: 

 

 

 * Increased transparency and trust: As mentioned earlier, blockchain is a transparent and tamper-proof ledger that enables all members of the network to see all transactions. This builds trust between parties involved in a transaction because there is no need for third-party verification. * Increased efficiency: With blockchain technology, businesses can conduct transactions without relying on intermediaries such as banks or credit card companies. This can save businesses time and money on transaction fees. * Enhanced security: Blockchain networks are secure due to their decentralized nature. The cryptography used in blockchains make them difficult to hack into or forge entries into.

Bitcoin and the Blockchain

In 2009, an anonymous person or group of people under the name Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin, the first decentralized cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is unique in that there is a finite number of them: 21 million. The Bitcoin protocol is also designed to generate a new block every 10 minutes, with each block containing a coinbase transaction rewarding the discoverer of the block with new bitcoins. This creates an incentive for miners to participate in the network and helps to secure it against attackers. Transactions on the Bitcoin network are verified by miners, who use special software to solve complicated mathematical puzzles in order to add a new block to the blockchain, a public ledger of all Bitcoin transactions.

The blockchain is a distributed database that allows any participant on the network to verify the validity of transactions without relying on a central authority. This makes it difficult for anyone to tamper with historical records or modify balances without being detected. The blockchain is also transparent, meaning that anyone can view it at any time. This makes bitcoin more trustworthy than government-issued currencies, which can be manipulated by governments or banks.

The value of bitcoin has seen significant volatility since its inception, but has generally trended upwards over time. In January 2017, one bitcoin was worth almost $1,000 USD, but this value crashed down to around $600 in February following reports that China was planning to ban cryptocurrency exchanges. Despite this volatility, bitcoin has remained more stable than most other cryptocurrencies and has become more widely accepted as a form of payment. As of May 2018, there were more than 17 million bitcoins in circulation with a total market capitalization of over $114 billion USD.
